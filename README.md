#  Dungeons & Dragons 5E Character Randomiser

This is a command line application I'm developing whilst learning c#.

The end goal is for it to generate a class that contains a randomised character (but consistent with the rules)

All content found within the application should only be sourced from the Open game licence SRD found here : https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd

Or here in website form: https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm

Please feel free to contribute, itâ€™s primarily here as a learning experience.
